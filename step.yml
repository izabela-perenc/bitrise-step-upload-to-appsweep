        Using a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, as the wrapper is used to call
        Gradle taks that is uploading an app. If gradle_path is not specified then gradlew is searched in repository root.        
        The path should be relative to the repository root. For example, `./gradlew`,
        or if it is in a sub directory, `./sub/dir/gradlew`.
