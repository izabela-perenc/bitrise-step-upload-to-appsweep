      description: |
        Using a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, as the wrapper is used to call the AppSweep
        Gradle taks to start the app scan. If `gradle_path` is not specified then gradlew is expected to be in your repository root.        
        The path should be relative to the repository root. For example, `./gradlew`, or `./sub/dir/gradlew`.
